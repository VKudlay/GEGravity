## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Converted the DESCRIPTION title to title case.
* Removed LICENSE file and "+ file LICENSE" as requested by reviewer
* Updated alpaca package address to canonical CRAN URL

## Test environments
* macOS Big Sur 11.4, R 4.0.3
* win-builder (devel and release)
* Using devtools 2.4.0

## devtools::check() RESULTS
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.
win-builder generated only `checking CRAN incoming feasibility` maintainer reminder

## Downstream dependencies
This is an initial release; there are no downstream dependencies.
