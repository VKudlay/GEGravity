Description: 
  This package solves for general equilibrium effects of changes in trade policies using 
  a one sector Armington-CES trade model. It uses a simple fixed point algorithm that allows for 
  fast computation and is ideal for bootstrapping confidence intervals for general equilibrium 
  simulations based on prior gravity estimates of FTAs or other similar variables. Note that this 
  package is directly associated with the ge_gravity Stata package and has been commissioned with 
  the appreciated support of the UK Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport.
